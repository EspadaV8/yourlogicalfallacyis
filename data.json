            "question": "What's this whole thing about, anyway?",
            "answer": "A while ago I was trying to explain logical fallacies to my two boys (you don't know who I am though, do you? I'm Jesse. Hello.). They're smart enough kids, but, you know, they're still kids - and so I tried to come up with really simple ways of explaining the concepts behind some of the more common fallacies.<br /><br />I found that distilling a fallacy into a single, simple sentence (without using any big pretentious words) was something of a challenge, but because I'm an ad guy I had some skillz with regard to making sure the lowest common denominator could understand the message (not that my kids are the lowest common denominator, but you get my point). So having simplified the explanations of some of the fallacies, I tried to come up with fun examples to go along with them. Then I thought 'hey, what if I were to make these into a poster infographic type thing that parents could hang on their kids' bedroom walls, and slightly nerdy students could hang in their apartments, and teachers could hang in their classrooms, and whatnot?' And that's how this project began.<br /><br />I've come to the conclusion that education is the single most vital, important thing that there is, and this website is my first attempt to bring my background in the dark arts of advertising to bear for a positive purpose - making educational materials that are simple, engaging and effective. If you like the cut of the jibs you see here, then please feel free to <a href=\"#donate\" title=\"donate\">donate money to me</a> which I may spend on future educational websites and things, or possibly on lunch/beer. It's a bit pot luck, really."

Call or email a couple of the businesses that do large format digital printing and explain that you have a print-ready under 1MB vector pdf file at A1/A2 size and you'd like a quote to have it printed. You may also want to ask them to include an option for lamination in your quote. Email them the file and you should be able to pick it up in the next day or so. If you're poor or stingy you can print it out on a laser printer at A3, but this version is simplified and doesn't include the funny examples and things."

Email or call a few of them and tell them you have a high resolution vector pdf file to print at A1/A2 (maybe get a quote for both sizes) and also ask them to quote for lamination.<br /><br />Otherwise you can print it out on a laser printer at A3 size, but note that this is a simplified version with just the basic description of each fallacy and no funny examples and junk (so that the text is readable at A3 size).

            "description": "One such mistake in thinking is the 'cum hoc ergo propter hoc' (with this, therefore because of this) fallacy in which someone presumes that because things are happening together that one thing is therefore the cause of the other. The mistake lies in ignoring the possibility that there may be a common cause to both things happening, or, as per the example below, that the two things in question have no causal relationship at all, and their apparent connection is just a coincidence. Another common variation is the 'post hoc ergo propter hoc' (after this, therefore because of this) fallacy in which a causal connection is assumed because one thing happens prior to another thing happening, therefore the second thing must be caused by the first thing.",

            "description": "Appeals to emotion include appeals to fear, envy, hatred, pity, pride, and more. It's important to note that sometimes a logically coherent argument may inspire emotion or have an emotional aspect, but the problem and fallacy occurs when emotion is used instead of a logical argument, or to obscure the fact that no compelling rational reason exists for one's position. Everyone, bar sociopaths, is affected by emotion, and so appeals to emotion are a very common and effective argument tactic, but they're ultimately flawed, dishonest, and tend to make one's opponents justifiably emotional.",
            "example": "Luke didn't want to eat his sheep's brains with chopped liver and brussel sprouts, but his father told him to think about the poor, starving children in a third world country who weren't fortunate enough to have any food at all."

            "description": "There are few things more frustrating than watching someone poorly argue a position one holds. Much of the time a debate is won not because the victor is right, but because s/he is better at debating than their opponent. If we're to be honest and rational, we must be mindful that just because someone made a mistake in their defence of an argument, it doesn't necessarily follow that the argument itself is wrong.",

            "description": "The problem with this reasoning is that it avoids engaging with the issue at hand, and instead shifts attention to extreme hypotheticals. Because no proof is presented to show that such extreme hypotheticals will in fact occur, this fallacy has the form of an appeal to emotion fallacy by leveraging fear. In effect the argument at hand is unfairly tainted by unsubstantiated conjecture.",

The implication is that if one's opponent also does the thing that they are accused of, then their opponent is a hypocrite. Irrespective of whether this might be true or not, the problem lies in the fact that it is effectively a tactic to avoid recognising and responding to the criticism of one's argument - by turning it back on the accuser, the accused doesn't need to answer the accusation.",

Rather than appreciate the benefits of being able to change one's mind through better understanding, many will invent ways to cling to old beliefs. One of the most common ways that people do this is to post-rationalize a reason why what they thought to be true must remain to be true. It's usually very easy to find a reason to believe something that suits us, and it requires integrity and genuine honesty with oneself to examine one's own beliefs and motivations without falling into the trap of justifying our existing ways of seeing ourselves and the world around us.",

The inability, or disinclination, to disprove a claim does not render that claim valid, nor give it any credence whatsoever. However it is important to note that we can never be certain of anything, and so we must assign value to any claim based on the available evidence, and to dismiss something on the basis that it hasn't been proven beyond all doubt is also fallacious reasoning.",

            "description": "Just because something is natural does not mean that it's good. For instance murder is very natural, but most of us agree that we don't think it's a very good thing to be doing, nor does its 'naturalness' constitute any kind of justification for it.",
            "example": "The medicine man rolled into town on his bandwagon offering various natural remedies, such as very special plain water. He said that it was only natural that people should be wary of 'artificial' medicines such as antibiotics."

            "description": "It's often much easier for people to believe someone's testimony as opposed to understanding complex data and variation across a continuum. Quantitative scientific measures are almost always more accurate than personal perceptions and experiences, but our inclination is to believe that which is tangible to us, and/or the word of someone we trust over a more 'abstract' statistical reality.",
            "example": "Jason said that that was all cool and everything, but his grandfather smoked, like, 30 cigarettes a day and lived until 97 - so don't believe everything you read about meta analyses of methodologically sound studies showing proven causal relationships."

Clusters naturally appear by chance, but don't necessarily indicate that there is a causal relationship.",
