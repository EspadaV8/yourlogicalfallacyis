<p>After launching this site we realised that it was costing people $60-$100 to have the posters individually printed, but by printing in bulk we could make it a lot cheaper.</p>
<p>We've set up a <a href="http://store.yourlogicalfallacyis.com" target="_blank" title="Buy via Shopify.com">shop</a> where you can order a <a class="preview" href="#" data-type="sml">16x24”</a> or <a class="preview" href="#"  data-type="lrg">24x36”</a> poster printed on high quality satin paper stock delivered to your door in the mainland USA for a flat rate of USD$20 including shipping and tax - extra for international orders. Rest assured that the money we make from it will go to a good cause (beer and/or education projects).</p>
<h4>Here are some reasons you might want to order one of these pretty great posters:</h4>
<ol>
	<li>To hang up near your computer for when you are arguing with people on the internets.</li>
	<li>To put up in your kids' bedroom so that they get all clever and whatnot, and are able to tell the difference between real news and faux news *cough*.</li>
	<li>To gift, in a slightly passive-aggressive yet still socially acceptable way, to someone who is forever making weak arguments peppered with fallacies.</li>
	<li>To hang up in a classroom, common room or other public space to make the world a more rational place.</li>
	<li>Potato.</li>
</ol>
